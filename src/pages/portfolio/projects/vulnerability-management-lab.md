## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Simulate a realistic Windows domain environment with common vulnerabilities
- Perform authenticated scans using Nessus
- Apply manual patches and validate remediation
- Document the entire vulnerability management lifecycle

## 🔐 Lab Highlights 

- Deployment of three virtual machines: 
  - **DC**: Windows Server 2016 configured as a Domain Controller
  - **CLIENT01**: Windows 10 client machine
  - **CLIENT02**: Windows 10 client machine 
- Networked environment with domain configuration
- Use of Nessus for vulnerability scanning
- Manual patching using Windows Update and PowerShell
- Documentation of scan results and remediation steps
