## 🛠️ Overview
This lab is a practical, enterprise-grade simulation of a misconfigured Windows domain environment. The lab is designed to mirror real-world Active Directory environments commonly found in corporate networks, complete with intentional misconfigurations that enable initial access, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and full domain compromise.
