## Vulnerable Active Directory Lab OSCP Style
Automated custom-built vulnerable Active Directory environment designed to simulate a full attack chain OSCP Style. This lab **automates the vulnerabilities in CLIENTS machines and DC**, in order for the scripts to work, the **Domain Controller has to be already created and the CLIENTS machines already joined to it**. This lab assumes a **breach scenario** as is common in real-world penetration testings. It also includes intensional misconfigurations such as an exposed SMB share with users files, users accounts that are AS-REP roastable and Kerberoastable, and privilege escalation paths that allow password changes for a privilege user. Exploiting these weaknesses step-by-step leads to a successful DCSync attack and full domain compromise.

## Lab Key Features
- **Active Directory Automated Domain setup:** Weak passwords, delegated permissions, GPO disables Defender, Firewall, Updates
- **Vulnerable User Accounts:** Kerberoasting, AS-REProastable
- **Privilege Escalation Paths:** Reset Password, DCSync
- **Hardening Bypass on CLIENT1:** RDP Access, SeImpersonatePrivilege
- **Exploitable SMB share on CLIENT2:** SMB folder with zip file
- Walktrough OSCP Style + Template using [Sysreptor](https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor)  

## Lab Objective
The goal of this lab is to simulate a realistic attack chain in an Active Directory environment. It shows how common misconfigurations and overlooked settings can be combined to compromise an entire domain. It can be used as reference for pentesters portfolio.

## To Download:
[Windows 10 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10)

[Windows Server 2016 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016)

## Environment Setup & Configuration

1. Import VMs in VirtualBox/VMware.

2. Assign Internal Network interfaces to VMs

3. Install Windows Server and Client ISO 

4. Create a new Forest on Windows Server
- Join CLIENTS to DC, all of them have to be in the same Internal network/share the same IP range
  ![lab39](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a996f85-1fc5-482b-b40a-eb05093b6937)
- Add a second Internal Network adapter to kali and Client1 for communication from VM Manager
  ![lab42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c38c8cc0-8ce2-4bad-9b21-79cfe1d06749)

- Set IP in CLIENT1 : 192.168.10.101
  ```
  Network & Internet Settings > Ethernet > Properties > IPv4
  IP: 192.168.10.101
  Netmask: 255.255.255.0
  ```
- Set IP in Kali : 192.168.10.100
  ```bash
  sudo ip addr add 192.168.10.100/24 dev eth1
  sudo ip link set eth1 up
  ```

> Take a snapshot of all 3 machines before running the scripts in order to be able to reset the changes.

## Sharing scripts to internal clients (CLIENT2 and DC)
   
1. Download the scripts to your kali machine and share them with python to download them from CLIENT1
  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server80
  ```
2. In CLIENT1 download the files and put them in a SMB Folder so they will be accessible from any machine
  ```powershell
  mkdir C:\FILES
  iwr -uri http://<IP>/DC_script.ps1 -Outfile DC_script.ps1 
  iwr -uri http://<IP>/c1_script.ps1 -Outfile c1_script.ps1
  iwr -uri http://<IP>/c2_script.ps1 -Outfile c2_script.ps1
  iwr -uri http://<IP>/images.zip -Outfile images.zip
  Share FILES directory
  ```

> You have to loggin in all machines as Domain Admin and run the scripts in a Powershell console as Administrator.

## Domain and Clients configuration

### DC
1.  Access \\\\Client1\SHARE and download [DC_script.ps1](https://github.com/reatva/Vulnerable-Active-Directory-Lab/blob/main/DC_script.ps1), open a Powershell console as Administrator and run the script. It will create domain users, AS-RERProastble and Kerberoastable users, create a GPO to disable windows updates, firewall and defender, assign Reset Password and DCSync permissions.
```powershell
powershell -ep bypass
.\DC_SCRIPT.PS1
```
  2. We restric LDAP queries for Nicol following the next steps. By restricting LDAP queries user Nicol won't be able to gather Domain info using tools as rpcclient or ldapsearch.
  ```
  Go to: Group Policy Management  
  	Group Policy Objects > Deny LDAP Access > Edit 
  		Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment
  			Deny Access to this computer from the network > Add User or Group > LDAP_Deny_Group
  ```
  3. As the final step we link the GPO to the Domain Controllers ( The script already creates the Group and the GPO but manual step is necessary)
  ```
  Go to : Group Policy Management
  	Domain Controllers > Right click > Link an existing GPO > Deny LDAP Access > OK
  ```    

### CLIENT 2
1. Access \\\\Client1\Share and copy [images.zip](https://github.com/reatva/Vulnerable-Active-Directory-Lab/blob/main/images.zip) & [c2_script.ps1](https://github.com/reatva/Vulnerable-Active-Directory-Lab/blob/main/c2_script.ps1), after that we run c2_script.ps1.
   ```powershell
   powershell -ep bypass
   .\c2_script.ps1
   ```
### CLIENT1
1. Finally, run [c1_script.ps1](https://github.com/reatva/Vulnerable-Active-Directory-Lab/blob/main/c1_script.ps1), this will add user Adrian to Local RDP Group, enable RDP, and enable Administrator's account.
   ```powershell
   powershell -ep bypass
   .\c2_script.ps1
   ```
2. To assign user adrian SeImpersonatePrivilege
  ```
  Go to:
  "Windows Administrative Tools" > "Local Security Poliy" > "Local Policies" "USer Rights Assignment" > "Impersonate client after authentication" > add > Adrian
  ```

## Attack Flow
