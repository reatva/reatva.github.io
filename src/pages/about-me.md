I'm glad to say that I'm now a [Offensive Security Certified Professional](https://credentials.offsec.com/6826491e-6fae-4696-8ede-b667f788bd63#acc.eFXI97pb) (OSCP/OSCP+), however let me explain it to you how it began.

## > How it started
Around a year and a half ago, I made a life-changing decision to pivot into cybersecurity.
At the time, I had no idea where to start, but I was driven by curiosity which turned into passion. 

I earned my [CompTIA Security+](https://www.credly.com/badges/e9b7d05e-1172-4259-b55c-f7bb640d6f89/linked_in_profile) certification after 3 months into my studies, but I knew that certificate alone wasn't enough,I needed hands-on experience.

I discovered the world of ethical hacking through [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) platform and [S4vitar's](https://www.youtube.com/@S4viSinFiltro) YouTube channel, which became my digital classroom. I spent countless hours learning, failing, and trying over and over again until I finally exploited my first machine.That small win felt like climbing a mountain and it gave me the confidence to go bigger.

I set my sights on the OSCP certificate. I enrolled, and for 3 intense months I committed fully: learning, practicing, failing, and growing deeper.
I tried hard and today, I’m proud to say that I am officially an OSCP.

## > Professional background
Before starting my jorney into Cybersecurity, I studied Communication Sciences with a focus on advertising. I worked in small companies where I developed creative thinking, strong communicacion skills, and the ability to understand and connect with diverse audiences. These experiences shaped my problem-solving mindset and adaptability, which later inspired me to transition into the dynamic field of cybersecurity.
